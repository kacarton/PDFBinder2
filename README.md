Installation and usage
----------------------

PDFBinder can be installed on Microsoft Windows systems using a pretty
installer, which can be downloaded from the GitHub repository.

In order to use PDFBinder on other platforms - or if the installer seems
like a bad choice for other reasons - PDFBinder can be built installed from
source. Grab the latest source package the GitHub repository. Use
whatever C# compiler you have available to build the project, or use the
provided project file for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 - 2015.

Hopefully, the user interface of PDFBinder is pretty self-explanatory. You
can add source PDF documents by using the "Add source documents..." button,
or by dragging the files in from a file browser. Documents can be moved up,
moved down or remoevd by pressing the respective buttons in the toolbar.
Press the "Bind!" button when your list of documents seems fine.

If PDFBinder was installed using the pre-built installer, an extra option
should have been automatically added to your context menu (the menu that on
Windows displays when right clicking a file) for all PDF files. Select any
number of PDFs in a file browser and choose the "Add to PDFBinder..." option
to bring up the PDFBinder interface with those files already in the list.
